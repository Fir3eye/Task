	--------> Master and Slave 	
	Step-1 Install mysql both master and slave	sudo apt-get update
		sudo apt-get install -y mysql-server
		sudo mysql_secure_installation
	Step-2. Edit /etc/mysql/mysqld.conf.d/mysqld.cnf	Bind_address = 0.0.0.0
	 in both master and slave server 	
	But Master server-id =1	server-id = 1 
	And Slave server-id =2	log_bin = /var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log 
		log_bin_index =/var/log/mysql/mysql-bin.log.index 
		relay_log = /var/log/mysql/mysql-relay-bin 
		relay_log_index = /var/log/mysql/mysql-relay-bin.index
	Step -3. only on master server --->Create user for Replication 	CREATE USER 'myreplica'@'slave-server-ip' IDENTIFIED WITH mysql_native_password BY 'Admin@123';
		GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'myreplica'@'slave-server-ip';
		SHOW GRANTS FOR 'myreplica'@'slave-server-ip';
		FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
	Restart Mysql 	systemctl restart mysql 
		systemctl status mysql 
		
	--------> Slave	
	Step -1. Login mysql	Mysql -u root -p
	Step-2. Go to master and check the position	show master status ; 
	Step-3. Stop Slave	STOP SLAVE;
	Change value 	MASTER_HOST : IP address of Master Server
		MASTER_USER :  Replication User of Master server that we had created in previous steps.
		MASTER_PASSWORD : Replication User Password of Master server that we had created in previous steps. 
		MASTER_LOG_FILE : Your Value of Master Log File of Master server
		MASTER_LOG_POS : Your value of Master Log Position of Master server
	Step -4. Before running change the ip with master server	CHANGE MASTER TO MASTER_HOST = '192.168.177.129', MASTER_USER = 'myreplica', MASTER_PASSWORD = 'Admin@123', MASTER_LOG_FILE = 'mysql-bin.000002', MASTER_LOG_POS = 157;
	Step-5 Start Slave	START SLAVE;
	Step-6. check connectivity	show slave status\G;
